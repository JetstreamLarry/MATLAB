Repo of all the matlab scripts i've written, either for university or personal use.
* "automatic_control" contains laboratory and lecture related scripts for the Automatic Control course at PoliTo.
* "functions" contains functions used in other scripts.
* "simulink" contains templates for Simulink simulations.
* "templates" contains barebones scripts with no preset values, used to quickly complete specific tasks (such as the laboratories mentioned above).
